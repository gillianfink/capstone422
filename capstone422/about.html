<div class="about">
	<p>New York City English is a regional dialect of American English spoken by residents of the five boroughs and surrounding metropolitan area. In part due to its pervasive media portrayals, it is one of the most recognizable dialects in the continent.  </p>
<p>While the dialect itself is constantly changing—some even fear the New York accent is dying—its character is representative of the city’s rich history of European immigration.</p>

<p>Younger generations are beginning to leave the accent behind, likely because of its connotations of being lower class, ethnic, or crude. Through this project, I aim to honor New York City English as a stamp of regional pride.</p>
